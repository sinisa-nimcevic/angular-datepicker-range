# angular-datepicker-range
A flexible date picker capable of taking a "from-to" range and calculating the day difference between them


- Use `date-from` and `date-to` attributes to two way bind date values
- Use `from-text` and `to-text` to pass label values as attributes

`<date-range-picker date-from="MCTRL.dateFrom" date-to="MCTRL.dateTo" from-text="From text" to-text="To text"></date-range-picker>`
